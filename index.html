    <h1>My Long Letter to You</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, Eunice this one's a long message for you. Alam mo naman gustong gusto
      kita at hindi ako madaling sumuko pero kelangan kong i-respeto ikaw pati
      narin sarili ko. Ayaw ko rin naman masaktan ka. Ang nakikita ko lang
      talaga hindi pa talaga siguro ngayon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grabe talaga kumilos si Lord noh? Biruin mo yun kagabi habang naguusap
      tayo at pinapatulog na si Vincent, naging anxious sya at di mapakali naka
      isa, dalawa, tatlong tayo siya na di mapakali. Yung pangatlong tayo nya
      kumuha sya ng bimpo/towel pamunas at ibinigay sakin without saying
      anything dun palang nagtaka na ako, bat ko naman ke-kelanganin yun? Then
      ngayon, I didn't imagine I'd need it dahil nagamit ko ngayon ng sobra
      sobra yung binigay nyang bimpo/towel. Grabe ka talaga gumalaw Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe in another time, we're going to meet again pero sa time na yun ready
      na, may mapagmamalaki na, at hindi na takot dahil pareho at parehas na
      tayong nasa best version ng sarili natin. Siguro nga ayun muna talaga yung
      nakatakda mangyari noh? Yung pangarap mong sinabi mo saakin na plinano nyo
      ng kuya mo? Siguraduhin mong kaya mo ahh at tutuparin mo yun, nasa sayo
      ang buong suporta ko. Aabutin ko din yung sakin. Tandaan mo, hindi ako
      galit at wala akong galit kahit kakaonti sayo, patawarin mo yung sarili mo
      dahil pinapatawad kita dahil pareho naman nating ginusto ito, wala tayong
      kasalanan dalawa sa isa't isa, don't think that it's your fault. What I
      want you to think is, this past few month we've been together hanging out
      and having fun together has been the happiest and greatest time of our
      life, because it is true. You are the best thing that happened in my life.
      Just trust me. Don't think of anything negative because I wouldn't want
      that. I'm okay and I truly understand what has happened and why we need to
      do this. Always remember that everything that I said is true and my will.
      Just keep my things and don't try to return them, I gave it to you with
      all my heart. Do what you want with it. I'll take care and protect all the
      things that you gave me with all my might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take care of yourself pu ha? Wag mong pabayaan yung sarili mong masaktan
      ng kahit na sino-man. Don't pressure yourself too much pu ha, okay? Don't
      push yourself too hard, take it easy. Rest when you need too. Always pray
      din pu ha. Lagi mong tatandaan na nandito ako palagi. I hope we can still
      be friends, I know we can. I'll still remember everything and I will never
      forget what we've had all this time we spent together. I wish you all the
      best and happiness. Nakakalungkot talaga Eunice :&lpar; I'll wait for you
      even if it took me long time. I will, pero along the way I'll meet many
      people. Don't worry uusad ako at hindi naman ako makukulong sayo. Don't
      think that I'll never move from this position. I'll use this as an
      inspiration to take the sky, the stars, and the life that I'm dreaming of.
      I respect you very much and your decision. Sayang eh, gusto ko kasama kita
      abutin lahat ng pangarap natin na magkasama sana eh. Maybe binibigyan
      talaga tayo ni Lord ng time para ayusin muna yung pareho natin pangarap at
      sarili. So that, when the time comes everything is ready na talaga. I want
      you to OPEN this and ask you.
